we split the Project into 3 seperate parts:
1. running a single benchmark
2. run benchmarks on a list of input trees and for a whole set of test configs
3. visualize data gathered by benchmarks

you find detailed discriptions for this 3 parts in the following directories:
1. src\benchmark\README.md
2. data_gen\README.md
3. data_vis\README.md

have fun :)
